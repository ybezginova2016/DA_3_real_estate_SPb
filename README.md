## üè¢ Real Estate Analysis Project: St. Petersburg

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze real estate data for apartments listed for sale in St. Petersburg and nearby towns. The goal is to identify trends and factors that influence property prices and to gain insights that could assist in decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

### Data
The dataset is collected via the Yandex Real Estate service and includes archived data from advertisements about apartments for sale in St. Petersburg and nearby towns. The data contains two types of variables for each apartment:
**User-added Variables:** These include attributes like the apartment's area, floor number, number of balconies, etc.
**Cartographic Variables:** These include the distance to significant locations such as the city center, airport, and nearest park.

Data can be found [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/DA_3_real_estate_SPb/blob/main/real_estate_data.csv).

### Analysis Goals
The analysis will focus on:
* Identifying key factors that influence the price of apartments.
* Understanding the distribution of apartment prices across different regions.
* Analyzing the relationship between cartographic variables (e.g., proximity to the city center) and apartment prices.
* Exploring trends in apartment features (e.g., size, floor number) and how they affect pricing.

### Results
The project will culminate in a series of visualizations and reports that provide:

* Insights into the pricing trends of apartments in St. Petersburg and nearby towns.
* An analysis of how various factors, both user-added and cartographic, influence the pricing of real estate.
* Recommendations for potential buyers or sellers based on the data analysis.
